# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
The most difficult part of tic-tac-toe was the has won function. This method was particulary difficult because I had to imagine each different outcome of a tic-tac-toe game on a list.
2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
You could add a computer by adding a randomizer for the oppisite player, this way a computer player would place letters in the game. One limitation to this is that it is random and wouldn't actually play correct moves against the player and would most likely lose most games.
3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.
If I were to add a computer player I would somehow implement AI through a database of tic-tac-toe knowledge.
